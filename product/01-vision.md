# Product Vision

## Context

Coday is a lightweight framework to use AI agents on existing scoped projects, with as much autonomy as wanted through
contextual understanding and tool integration. It runs locally and interfaces with various APIs and tools to provide a
comprehensive assistance experience, or even full-autonomous work capability.

AI is here for good but not autonomous enough to be let go on existing projects without significant preparation. Coday's
aim is to target directly the endgoal of agents and not view them as tool extensions for manual directions, but as tool
users for light supervision.

By focusing on connecting advanced AI models, existing tools and project knowledge, Coday can stay relevant at low cost
in an ever accelerating software landscape. Through its multi-agent architecture, it leverages both project-specific
agents and internal technical agents to provide sophisticated capabilities while maintaining operational simplicity.

## Goals

1. Future proofing AI use on projects
    - Leverage state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to benefit naturally from their future capabilities
    - No strings attached to existing software
    - Simple everlasting interfaces: terminal chat, web chat
   - Support for diverse agent types and team collaboration
   - Integration with specialized platform capabilities

2. Tool Enhancement
    - Extend AI capabilities through well-defined tools
    - Context-aware operations
    - Tooling tailored to project's current possibilities

3. Contextual Intelligence
    - Understanding of project structure
    - Memory of past interactions
    - Learning on the way through memorization
   - Intelligent task routing through specialized agents
   - Team-based problem-solving capabilities

## Non-Goals

- Not a replacement for existing IDE features
- Not a project management system
- Not a deployment platform
