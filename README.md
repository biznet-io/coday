# Coday

## Description

This project is an AI LLM (default being Openai/ChatGPT) wrapper to allow natural and semi-autonomous task handling by:
- exposing a project's files (read, write, search, list)
- higher level instructions by combining several low-level ones
- [future] automatically split a work assignment into tasks and sub-tasks
- [future] expose a selection of APIs: Jira, Gitlab, git

The core principle is to exhaust a FILO queue of commands, the first one being the request typed by the user. Each command being consumed by the first accepting handler found. Handlers can push several commands in the queue, decomposing high-level instructions into lower-level ones.

The final aim is to let Coday read a user story and do the heavy work of splitting it, branching, writing code in between workflow steps (compile, run tests, etc...).

## Roadmap

A roadmap is a joke as of writing ðŸ¤£, but the following points need to be addressed:
- heuristic to decide when to split a task (number of impacted files ?) and how to proceed (identify tasks that are deploy-ready vs sub-tasks that just compile?) ?
- project discovery: how the LLM can understand a new project ? It needs to dig in source code and get an understanding
- use project tools: how to compile a project ? how to update its dependencies ? Should the LLM guess the commandlines to run (dangerous ?) or should the project be "Coday-ready" by exposing directly a `build-frontend.sh` script ?
